# autoDoc
Simple program to automate the creation of routine report forms tied to certain weekdays for a given year.
It's made to be compiled to a single executable file, so the path has to be changed (using 'os.getcwd()' or something) for it to work when run from python in a terminal directly.

The template file, 'Mal.docx', must exist in the folder the program is run from.
